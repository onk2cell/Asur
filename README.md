To download the files in a virtual environment, follow these steps:

1. Set up a virtual environment using a tool like `virtualenv` or `venv`. Assuming you have `virtualenv` installed, open a command prompt or terminal and run the following command:
   - For `virtualenv`:
     ```
     virtualenv myenv
     ```
   - For `venv` (Python 3.3+):
     ```
     python -m venv myenv
     ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - For Windows:
     ```
     myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - For macOS/Linux:
     ```
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```

3. Navigate to the directory where you want to download the files from the GitHub repository.

4. Clone the GitHub repository by running the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/onk2cell/Asur.git
   ```

5. Change to the downloaded repository directory:
   ```
   cd Asur
   ```

6. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

This command will install all the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file into your virtual environment.

7. After installing the requirements, open the code files in a text editor and locate the place where the Bard API key needs to be filled. Replace `YOUR_BARD_API_KEY` with your actual Bard API key.

10. Save the changes to the code files.

11. You can now run the code using the following command:
   ```
   python jarvis.py
   ```

Replace `your_code_file.py` with the name of the Python file containing your code.

The code will now execute within the virtual environment, using the installed dependencies and the specified Bard API key.

The above code is designed to process speech input, extract movie keywords, and open corresponding Google Drive search links for each keyword. It utilizes various libraries and APIs to achieve this functionality.

Here's a short description of the code:

1. The code uses the `speech_recognition` library to capture speech input from the user via a microphone.
2. The captured speech is then processed using the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API for speech recognition.
3. The recognized speech is combined with a predefined message and passed to the Bard API, which returns an answer based on the provided input.
4. The answer is analyzed, and movie keywords are extracted using regular expressions.
5. Duplicate movie keywords are removed from the extracted list.
6. The extracted movie keywords are used to generate corresponding Google Drive search links.
7. The code opens each Google Drive search link in separate Chrome tabs using the `undetected_chromedriver` library.
8. The answer from Bard API, along with the extracted movie keywords, is converted to speech using the `pyttsx3` library and played back to the user.
9. The code includes error handling and waits for a certain amount of time before exiting.

Overall, this code combines speech recognition, natural language processing, web scraping, and text-to-speech conversion to create an interactive experience where users can provide speech input, receive answers based on that input, and explore movie-related content through Google Drive search links.
