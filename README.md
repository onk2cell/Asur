To download the files in a virtual environment, follow these steps:

1. Set up a virtual environment using a tool like `virtualenv` or `venv`. Assuming you have `virtualenv` installed, open a command prompt or terminal and run the following command:
   - For `virtualenv`:
     ```
     virtualenv myenv
     ```
   - For `venv` (Python 3.3+):
     ```
     python -m venv myenv
     ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - For Windows:
     ```
     myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - For macOS/Linux:
     ```
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```

3. Navigate to the directory where you want to download the files from the GitHub repository.

4. Clone the GitHub repository by running the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/onk2cell/Asur.git
   ```

5. Change to the downloaded repository directory:
   ```
   cd Asur
   ```

6. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

This command will install all the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file into your virtual environment.

7. After installing the requirements, open the code files in a text editor and locate the place where the Bard API key needs to be filled. Replace `YOUR_BARD_API_KEY` with your actual Bard API key.

10. Save the changes to the code files.

11. You can now run the code using the following command:
   ```
   python jarvis.py
   ```

Replace `your_code_file.py` with the name of the Python file containing your code.

The code will now execute within the virtual environment, using the installed dependencies and the specified Bard API key.
